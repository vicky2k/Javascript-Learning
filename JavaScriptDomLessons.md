### My Highlights from Chapter 5 of the Learning Resource: Javascript and the DOM

I Learnt how to target elements in the DOM with query Selector Methods like 

- document.querySelector()
- document.querySelectorAll()
- document.getElementById()
- document.getElementByClassName()
- document.getElementByTagName()

Also Read only methods like Classlist can be only interacted with using Methods such as 
Add, Remove, Toggle, Item and Contains.

Attributes Properties such as class, id, fontsize, color etc are also read only and requires the use of methods for manipulation. 
These attribute methods are has, get, set and remove.

For DOM Element creation methods, we use

Object.CreateElement();
.CreateTextNode();
.appendChild();
